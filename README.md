A graph neural network framework for robust cell type annotation in tumor microenvironments. It integrates functional state pseudo-labels (e.g., angiogenesis, apoptosis) with graph structure learning to achieve 82.82% accuracy across 38,667 cells from 15 patients (leukemia, breast cancer, colorectal cancer). Supports cross-patient generalization and unsupervised discovery of disease-specific interactions (e.g., STAT3-CD274).
